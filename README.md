## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is a hands-on implementation for the Operating Systems course, focusing on process management, inter-process communication, and clock synchronization. The codebase demonstrates how to build, run, and extend a modular OS simulation using C and Makefile.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **Modularity:** Each component (e.g., clock, scheduler, process generator) is separated for clarity and maintainability.
- **Synchronization:** A custom clock module (`headers.h`) provides precise timing and synchronization for all processes.
- **Automation:** The Makefile automates compilation and execution, making it easy to build and test the project.
- **Extensibility:** New modules or features can be added by updating the Makefile and including the appropriate headers.

---

## 🏗️ Key Components

- **headers.h:** Contains clock functions. Must be included in any file that uses timing or synchronization.
- **getClk():** Call this function to retrieve the current clock value for process synchronization.
- **Makefile:** Automates building and running the project. Ensures all dependencies are compiled and linked correctly.

## 🚀 How to Build & Run

1. **Compile the project:**
    ```bash
    make
    ```
2. **Run the project:**
    ```bash
    make run
    ```
3. **Add new files:**  
   If you add a new source file, include it in the build section of the Makefile.

> **Note:** Always start each command in the Makefile with a tab character (not spaces) — this is required by Makefile syntax.

## ⚙️ How We Designed the Project

- **Clock Synchronization:**  
  We created a dedicated clock module to ensure all processes operate in sync, simulating real OS timing.
- **Process Management:**  
  The design allows for easy spawning, scheduling, and termination of processes, mimicking real OS behavior.
- **Build Automation:**  
  Using a Makefile streamlines the workflow, reduces manual errors, and makes the project accessible for all team members.
- **Documentation:**  
  Every function and module is documented for clarity and future extension.

## 📝 Tips & Best Practices

- Always include `headers.h` in any file that needs clock functions.
- Use `getClk()` to access the current time in your modules.
- Update the Makefile whenever you add new source files.
- Keep your code modular and well-documented for easier debugging and grading.
